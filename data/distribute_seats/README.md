This is the tooling to distribute seats amongst districts based on the vote
count in the districts. The script takes the votes distribution (first
column should be the district, subsequent any number of columns should sum
up to the vote count for that district), and returns a table where the
first column is the district, and the second column is the number of seats.

Assumes 460 seats to distribute.
