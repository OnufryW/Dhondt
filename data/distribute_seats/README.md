This is the tooling to distribute seats amongst districts proportionally
to any numeric parameter in the districts. The script takes the parameter
distribution (first column should be the district, subsequent any number of
columns should sum up to the parameter for that district), and returns a 
table where the first column is the district, and the second column is the
number of seats.

Assumes 460 seats to distribute.
