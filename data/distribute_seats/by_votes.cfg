# Params:
# votes: the source of a table with a column "id" (the district ID), and
#        any number of numeric columns (the number of votes, it works if
#        there's only one column, or if there's an arbitrary number of
#        per-party columns.
# method: right now, has to be the string "dhondt". This is future-proofing,
#         if I implement other seat-assignment aggregations like Saint-Lague,
#         or smallest-remainder.
