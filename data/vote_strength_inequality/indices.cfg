# Params:
# - vote_data: a "just votes" config, with an "id" column and per-party vote.
#   Note that we don't need the per-party vote, just the total vote counts per
#   district, but standard vote data numbers contain the per-party vote.
# - seat_data: a table that contains columns "id" and "seats".

# Sample usage
# python3 ../../python_lib/transform.py ../dump.cfg 
#         i vote_strength_inequality/indices.cfg
#         vote_data ../sejm_election_results/just_votes.cfg
#         pure_election_results by_district.cfg
#         c 2023_by_community.cfg
#         seat_data ../district_definitions/2023.cfg
