# What this does is remove the columns corresponding to the parties that
# are listed as having zero votes. Presumably after running apply_threshold
# to zero out votes for the parties that didn't cross the threshold.

# Sample usage:
# python3 ../python_lib/cadmium.py dump.cfg
#   i committee_data/remove_zero_parties.cfg
#   votes apply_threshold.cfg
#   threshold_data 2015.csv
#   votes_by_district ../sejm_election_results/just_votes.cfg
#   pure_election_results by_district.cfg
#   c 2015_by_community.cfg

INPUT TABLES votes;
PIVOT votes WITH OLD_HEADERS_TO Party WITH NEW_HEADERS_FROM name(1);
TRANSFORM votes WITH Party AS Party, int(curr()) FOR 2:;
TRANSFORM votes WITH curr() FOR : AS currname(), sum_range(2:) AS total;
FILTER votes BY total > 0;
# The only thing missing is keeping the name of column 1.
# I'm not sure it can be done right now, but I'd prefer it if I had the
# PARAM command that allows me to define a new param in the context of
# some table (where I run some query).
