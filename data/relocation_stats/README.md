Contains configs for relocation and right to vote data for 2023 Sejm
elections.

Joined data available in "summary_data_by_community.cfg" and
"summary_data_by_district.cfg"

"Relocation" means a voter applied to change his assigned place of voting
as a one-time change prior to the vote.

"Right to vote" means that a voter applied for an official "right to vote"
paper, which entitles to vote anywhere by giving up the paper.

For relocation, we have data on both the source and the target place of
voting (where the source might be empty, in the sense that the voter might
have not been registered to vote anywhere).

For right to vote, we have only source data here (that is, the fact that
a voter requested their right-to-vote paper is registered here. The target
data is listed in the PKW data, and not here.
