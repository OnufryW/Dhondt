# General relocation and right-to-vote stats.
# Contains the following columns:
# 1 teryt (a short teryt, five or six digit, with 149901 as "out of country")
# 2 voters_relocating_into_community_from_other_community
# 3 voters_relocating_into_community_from_nowhere
# (the former is "they got papers from another community", the latter is 
#  "they got papers because they're citizens, but weren't registered voters
#   in another community")
# 4 voters_relocating_out_of_community
# 5 voters_recorded_in_community_taking_right_to_vote
# 6 voters_unrecorded_in_community_taking_right_to_vote
# (the latter are people not registered as voters in a community, who still
#  got proof of living in the community, and so received a right-to-vote bill)
# 7 voters_using_right_to_vote
#
# In a perfect world, sum(2) = sum(4), and sum(5+6) = sum(7)
