# Params:
# - vote_data: a "just votes" config, with an "id" column and per-party vote
#   The typical place to get this is sejm_election_results/just_votes.cfg,
#   which requires the pure_election_results param.
# - seat_data: a table that contains columns "id" and "seats" (#seats)

# Sample usage:
# python3 ../python_lib/transform.py dump.cfg i election_results.cfg
#         vote_data sejm_election_results/just_votes.cfg
#         pure_election_results by_district.cfg
#         c 2023_by_community.cfg
#         seta_data district_definitions/2023.cfg
