# This config contains an expresion that describes how to calculate the
# stddev of a distribution of votes for a single committee in a single
# district. As an input, it takes two values: T (the total number of votes
# we expect in this district), and V (the expected value of the number of
# votes for our committee).

# This is somewhat of a guesswork - there are many sources of error here.
# TODO: run a test, where we try to predict 2019 results using 2015 data
# with our methodology, and see what sorts of errors we get.
# Note that it's a pure guess that T and V are the most relevant values
# here, but it seems to be a reasonably well-educated one (and I actually
# believe the key value is V/T, plus the stddev will be proportional to
# V (or to T, since we know their quotient).

# I use sqrt((V/T) (1 - V/T)) as the baseline, just because that's the
# typical variance of sampling (if you take N samples of something that
# is 1 with probability P, then the stddev is sqrt(P(1-P)/N)).

T * sqrt( (V/T) * (1 - V/T) ) / 15

# Scaled so that a committee with support around 10% will have an stddev
# of 3%, which is my gut feel about what we should get.
# (note: survey results for a committee with support around 10% - of which
#  we have 3 - have an stddev of roughly 1.5%. Predictions from 2015 to
#  2019 had an stddev of 1.9%. Summing this gives an stddev of ~2.4%,
#  I think rounding up to 3% is probably fair to account for population and
#  three weeks of drift).
