# This config describes how to translate vote counts in previous elections
# (on a set of parties that is different than the one in the current
# election) to vote counts in this election.
# It generally follows the pattern of
# Foo = 0.5 * Baz + 0.3 * Bar + 0.2 * Qux
# Where "Foo" is a name of a party in the current election, and
# Baz, Bar and Qux are suffixes or prefixes of names of parties / 
# candidates in previous elections.
# The formula is applied without any scaling, either with respect to
# survey results or to population count changes, it's just applied as-is.

# We could also add some data from the presidential election, but, meh...

Lewica = "-1/19"
Koalicja Obywatelska = "-6/19"
Konfederacja = "-5/19"
Mniejszość Niemiecka = "-15/19"
Prawo i Sprawiedliwość =  "-9/19"

# There's a judgement call here - how to weigh the results of PSL and of
# Hołownia into TD's result. I'm (totally arbitrarily) assigning a 50/50
# split between them. Generally all the results are scaled to the 2019
# total votes, so I'll do that as well here - since PSL got 8.55 votes total
# and Hołownia got 13.87% in presidential elections, I'll scale Hołownia
# down to 8.55% (so that results are comparable with PSL), and then take
# the average of the two.

Trzecia Droga = "-19/19" * 0.5 + "HOŁOWNIA" * 0.5 * (8.55 / 13.87)

# They're likely not getting in, but they started in 2019 as well, so it's
# easy to get.

Bezpartyjni Samorządowcy = "-10/19"
