# This config describes how to translate vote counts in previous elections
# (on a set of parties that is different than the one in the current
# election) to vote counts in this election.
# It generally follows the pattern of
# Foo = 0.5 * Baz + 0.3 * Bar + 0.2 * Qux
# Where "Foo" is a name of a party in the current election, and
# Baz, Bar and Qux are suffixes or prefixes of names of parties / 
# candidates in previous elections.
# The formula is applied without any scaling, either with respect to
# survey results or to population count changes, it's just applied as-is.

# We could also add some data from the presidential election, but, meh...
